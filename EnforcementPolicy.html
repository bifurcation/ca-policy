<h1>Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy</h1>
<h3>(DRAFT Version 2.3)</h3>

<p>This section of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a>
 describes the steps that Mozilla may take in order to enforce this 
policy. This includes evaluation of security concerns, and removing or 
disabling a root certificate.</p>

<p>This is the official Mozilla policy for enforcing the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy:</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root 
compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/bugs/">Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs</a> should be followed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mozilla may, at its sole discretion, disable (partially or fully)
 or remove a certificate at any time and for any reason. Mozilla will 
disable or remove a certificate if the CA demonstrates ongoing or 
egregious practices that do not maintain the level of service that was 
established in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/inclusion/">Inclusion Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy</a> or that do not comply with the requirements of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/maintenance/">Maintenance Section of the Mozilla CA Certificate Policy.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our 
users if we learn that a CA has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued 
one or more certificates. This may include, but is not limited to 
disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all of the CA’s 
certificates from Mozilla’s products. A certificate that includes domain
 names that have not been verified according to Section 3.2.2.4 of the <cite><a href="https://www.cabforum.org/documents.html"> CA/Browser Forum’s Baseline Requirements</a></cite>
 is considered to be mis-issued. A certificate that is intended to be 
used only as an end entity certificate but includes a keyUsage extension
 with values keyCertSign and/or cRLSign or a basicConstraints extension 
with the cA field set to true is considered to be mis-issued.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A certificate is disabled by turning off one or more of the three
 trust bits (Websites, Email, Code Signing).
    Disablement or removal of a certificate may be initiated by 
submitting a bug report to the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described
 in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a> or the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/">Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA’s certificate(s) from 
Mozilla’s products based on a CA’s actions (or failure to act) that are 
contrary to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy,</a>
 Mozilla shall publicize that fact in newsgroups on the news.mozilla.org
 server, on Web pages in the www.mozilla.org and www.mozilla.com 
domains, in news releases sent to organizations specializing in computer
 and Internet news, or as an alert to the US-CERT organization of the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This policy applies only to software products distributed by Mozilla,
 including the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries. Other entities 
distributing such software are free to adopt their own policies. In 
particular, under the terms of the
relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors of such software are permitted 
to add or delete CA certificates in the versions that they
distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of the "trust 
bits" on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set. As with 
other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may 
affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its 
versions of the software; see the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/trademarks/policy/">Mozilla trademark policy</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Please contact Mozilla at <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> for more information about this policy and answers to related questions.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. We will do 
so only after consulting with the public Mozilla community, in order to 
ensure that all views are taken into account.</p>
